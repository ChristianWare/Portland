## Description:

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I built it to introduce myself to the web development world. You will learn a little bit about me, my skills, and some of my recent projects I've built using Next JS. Each project will give you access to the code, as well as the live site. There is also a contact section outlining the many ways to get in touch with me. My site is mobile responsive and received perfect scores on Google's Page Speed Insights. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
